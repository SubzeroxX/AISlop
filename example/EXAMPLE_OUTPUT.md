# Personal Portfolio Website

## Project Overview

This is CENSORED's personal portfolio website, showcasing his skills, experience, and projects as a junior software developer and QA technician. Built with modern web technologies, the site features a responsive design with smooth animations, a light/dark theme toggle, and interactive elements such as a typing effect and smooth scrolling navigation.

## Features

- **Interactive Typing Effect**: The hero section displays a dynamic typing animation cycling through various professional titles.
- **Light/Dark Theme Toggle**: Users can switch between light and dark modes with persistent preference saved in localStorage.
- **Smooth Navigation**: All internal links use smooth scrolling for a seamless user experience.
- **Responsive Design**: The site adapts to different screen sizes with mobile-friendly layout.
- **Animated Sections**: Sections such as skills, stats, and projects use CSS animations to create visual interest.
- **Interactive Project Cards**: Hover effects provide visual feedback when users interact with project cards.
- **Contact Form**: A functional form that opens the user's email client with pre-filled details.
- **Scroll-to-Top Button**: Appears when scrolling down and allows users to quickly return to the top.

## Technologies

- **HTML5**: For semantic structure and content organization.
- **CSS3**: For styling, responsive design, and animations (including custom properties, transforms, and transitions).
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**: For interactive functionality including typing effect, theme toggle, navigation, animations, and form handling.
- **Font Awesome**: For icons in the navigation and social links.
- **Google Fonts**: Inter font for consistent typography.
- **Intersection Observer API**: For triggering animations when elements enter the viewport.

The site structure is minimal and efficient, with all assets organized in the root directory. The project uses a clean, modern approach with a focus on both aesthetics and functionality.

## Usage

The website is ready for immediate use as a personal portfolio. Visitors can explore the content through the navigation menu, which includes sections for:

- **Home** (hero section with typing effect)
- **About** (personal background and education)
- **Skills** (skills with progress bars)
- **Education** (academic and vocational training)
- **Projects** (list of personal projects)
- **Contact** (email contact form)

## Developer Notes

- The site features a responsive design that works on both desktop and mobile devices.
- Theme preferences are stored in localStorage to persist across sessions.
- All animations use CSS-based transitions and transforms for performance.
- The contact form opens the email client without requiring server-side processing.
- The floating elements in the hero section use JavaScript for subtle motion effects.
- A parallax effect is applied to floating elements during scrolling.

This portfolio is a strong example of a modern, user-friendly personal website that effectively communicates the developer's skills and experience through an engaging and interactive interface.
